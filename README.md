# Rough-Tweaks-Revamped
This mod is originally by Lellson usually used in pair with other mods that make the game harder.

It adds:

### Healing Salve :
- The Healing Salve is the least aiding item in the mod, it lasts up to 4 uses, retains 0.5 hearts per use and is very annoying to craft!

### Plaster :
- The Plaster is yet another healing item, it lasts up to 4 uses, retains 0.5 hearts per use but it's more easier to craft than a salve!

### Bandage :
- The Bandage is a better healing item than both the plaster and the bandage, it lasts up to 6 uses, takes a little longer to use, retains 0.5 hearts per use and is very easy to craft!

### Medkit :
- The Medkit is a good replacement for all of the above, it lasts up to 16 uses, takes much longer to use, retains 1 heart per use, but it requires all of the above plus some quartz and nether warts to craft!

### Enchanted Medkit :
- The Enchanted Medkit is the best healing item in the mod, it lasts up to 16 uses (just like a normal medkit!), takes as long as a normal medkit to use, retains 1.5 hearts per use and gives absorption effect to the consumer, but requires a medkit, a golden apple and a ghast tear!
